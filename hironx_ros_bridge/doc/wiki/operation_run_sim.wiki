== Steps for running simulation ==

 1. First, cast a magic spell to load a configuration for `rtm` environment common for simulation:

 {{{
$ source `rospack find openrtm_tools`/scripts/rtshell-setup.sh
 }}}

   {{{#!wiki blue/solid
    The above command includes setting `PYTHONPATH` for [[http://wiki.ros.org/rtshell|rtshell]], creating aliases to more easily run `rtm` tools, such as:
   }}}
   {{{
$ alias rtmlaunch='`rospack find hrpsys_ros_bridge`/scripts/rtmlaunch'
$ alias rtmtest='`rospack find hrpsys_ros_bridge`/scripts/rtmtest'
   }}}

 2. Launch a simulator that "mimic"s a real robot.

 {{{
$ rtmlaunch hironx_ros_bridge hironx_ros_bridge_simulation.launch   (HIRO)
$ rtmlaunch nextage_ros_bridge nextage_ros_bridge_simulation.launch (NEXTAGE OPEN)
 }}}

   {{{#!wiki blue/solid
    This launch file does mainly following two things:
   }}}
   First, load a virtual robot on the simulator by:
   {{{
$ rtmlaunch hironx_ros_bridge hironx_startup.launch
   }}}
    
   This simulated robot (and the real one too) runs only on `OpenRTM`-based software. Now, in order for you to operate the robot via ROS, we need to create a "bridge" between two worlds.
   {{{
$ roslaunch hironx_ros_bridge hironx_ros_bridge.launch    (HIRO)
$ roslaunch nextage_ros_bridge nextage_ros_bridge.launch    (NEXTAGE OPEN)
   }}}

 If you see the following or similar on command prompt, your simulator is good:

 {{{
[ INFO] [1375160303.399785831, 483.554999999]: [HrpsysSeqStateROSBridge0] @onExecutece 0 is working at 201[Hz]
[ INFO] [1375160304.408500642, 484.544999999]: [HrpsysSeqStateROSBridge0] @onExecutece 0 is working at 198[Hz]
 }}}

 And a robot on `hrpsys-simulator` viewer:
