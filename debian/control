Description: The rtmros_hironx package is an operating interface via ROS and OpenRTM, for Hiro and NEXTAGE OPEN dual-armed robots from Kawada Industries Inc. NOTE for Hiro users: Utilizing this opensource controller for Hiro requires installation both on Controller Box (QNX-based) and Vision PC (Ubuntu Linux), and the steps for it are not shared publicly in order to avoid any possible inconvenience that can easily be caused by slight mis-operation during installation. Please contact TORK for an advice.
